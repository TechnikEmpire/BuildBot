# BuildBot
Cross platform, simple build system in pure C# based on .NET core app &amp; standard library.

The purpose of this small, portable application is to enable C# developers to use C# not only to write their software, but to write the build scripts for their software in the same language. Note however that you're not constrained to only building .NET software with this utility, you can build anything because you have the power of a fully featured software platform at your disposal. In summary:

- Strongly typed code vs script.  
- Compile time error checking vs runtime trial and error.  
- Because it's a programming language, syntax highlighting, code completion and debugging vs guessing in gedit, vim or nano and running to find your errors.  
- Fully featured platform functionality vs relying on make/build system exported features.
- Cross platform features exposed by .NET core means 1 compilation script per target for all platforms is possible.
