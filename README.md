# BuildBot
Cross platform, simple build system in pure C# based on .NET core app &amp; standard library.

The purpose of this small, portable application is to enable .NET developers to use any .NET language not only to write their software, but to write their build system in the same language that their software is built in. Note however that you're not constrained to only building .NET software with this utiltiy, you can build anything because you have the entire power of a fully featured software platform at your disposal. That's the point.
